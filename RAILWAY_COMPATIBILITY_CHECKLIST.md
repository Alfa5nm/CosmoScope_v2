deploy-railway.bat
```

## 🎯 **Railway vs Render Comparison**

| Feature | Railway | Render | CosmoScope Support |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **Free Tier** | 500 hours/month | 750 hours/month | ✅ Both supported |
| **Build Time** | ~2-3 minutes | ~3-5 minutes | ✅ Optimized |
| **Cold Start** | ~10-15 seconds | ~30-60 seconds | ✅ Fast startup |
| **Database** | Built-in PostgreSQL | External services | ✅ SQLite works |
| **File Storage** | Persistent volumes | Ephemeral | ✅ Compatible |
| **Configuration** | `railway.json` | `render.yaml` | ✅ Both configured |

## 🚨 **Potential Issues & Solutions**

### ⚠️ **Cold Start Performance**
- **Issue**: First request might be slow
- **Solution**: Railway's cold start is faster than Render
- **Mitigation**: Consider paid plan for always-on

### ⚠️ **File Storage**
- **Issue**: SQLite database persistence
- **Solution**: Railway provides persistent volumes
- **Backup**: Regular database backups recommended

### ⚠️ **Memory Usage**
- **Issue**: 3D graphics and mapping libraries
- **Solution**: Code splitting reduces initial load
- **Monitoring**: Use Railway metrics to track usage

## ✅ **Final Verdict**
