- **Secondary ISS**: 150px × 75px, 30-second animation cycle with 10s delay
- **Effects**: Glowing drop-shadow, smooth movement with wave-like motion

## Setup Instructions

1. **Add your space background** as `space-background.jpg` in this directory
2. **Add your ISS image** as `iss-space-station.png` in this directory
3. **The landing page is already configured** to use both images automatically

Once both images are added, the landing page will display your custom space background with the animated ISS moving across the screen!
